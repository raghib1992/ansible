Summary
Checklist for setting up a passwordless remote user


1. [control-machine] Make sure to generate a key pair ( ./key is the private and ./key.pub is the public) by running ssh-keygen -f key

2. [control-machine] Make sure that the private key has the permission 400  ( chmod 400 key ).

3. [target-host] Create a user (.e.g: called ansibleuser ) on the target host ( e.g: adduser ansibleuser , or , useradd -m -d /home/ansibleuser -s /bin/bash ansibleuser )

4. [target-host] Check what's the home directory of the ansibleuser. Make sure he has a home directory

getent passwd "ansibleuser" | cut -d: -f6
5. [target-host] Make sure that the login shell of the ansibleuser is NOT usr/sbin/nologin or /bin/false . Instead, it should be /bin/bash or /bin/sh ,... so on : 

getent passwd "ansibleuser" | cut -d: -f7
6. [target-host] Make sure to place the CONTENT of the  public key (key.pub) under the home directory of the remote user and specially as content of the file  ${HOME}/.ssh/authorized_keys .

7. [target-host] .ssh/ directory and .ssh/authorized_keys must have the following permissions:

chmod 700 ${HOME}/.ssh
chmod 600 ${HOME}/.ssh/authorized_keys
8. [target-host] Make sure SSHD is running systemctl status sshd .

9. [target-host] Make sure that SSHD allows PublicKeyAuthentication by checking its config file: 

grep PubkeyAuthentication /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# must return: 'PubkeyAuthentication yes'
if it  is not the case, you need to update the configuration file /etc/ssh/sshd_config then restart SSH again systemctl restart sshd .

10. [control-machine] Make sure there is no firewall block the SSH communication

netcat -zv <ip.of.target.host> 22



11. [control-machine] Now let's try to connect : ssh -i key ansibleuser@<ip.of.target.host>

________

NOTES:

- If it does not work after following all these steps, keep running  ssh -i key ansibleuser@<ip.of.target.host> -vvvv  , checking the stdout (output of command) until making it work.

- The ansible role abdennour.bootstrap has been designed to cover all these steps automatically. If you are familiar with Ansible role, you can use it. If not, we will cover Ansible Roles in the subsequent lecture & you  will be able to automate everything even bootstrapping your servers with a passwordless remote user.
