The Ansible lineinfile module is used to manage lines in text files. It can be used to add, modify, remove, or replace a line in a file, or to ensure that a particular line is present in a file.

The lineinfile module takes a number of parameters, including:

path: The path to the file to be modified.
line: The line to be added, modified, removed, or replaced.
state: The desired state of the line. The possible states are present, absent, and matched.
insertbefore: If the state is present, this parameter specifies the line before which the new line should be inserted.
insertafter: If the state is present, this parameter specifies the line after which the new line should be inserted.
backup: Whether or not to create a backup of the file before making any changes.
